# 🗺️ 3D Spatial Scanner Concept for AndrioV2

## 🎯 **Concept Overview**
A 3D spatial mapping tool that scans outward from the world origin (0,0,0) in ALL directions to create a comprehensive spatial awareness system for AndrioV2.

## 🔍 **Core Functionality**
- **360-degree spherical scan** from world origin
- **Directional mapping** (North, South, East, West, Up, Down)
- **Distance calculations** from origin to all actors
- **Spatial clustering analysis** 
- **Quadrant/region organization**

## 🧠 **Spatial Awareness Benefits**
AndrioV2 would gain the ability to:
- Understand spatial layout of entire level
- Describe actor positions relative to world center
- Identify spatial patterns and clusters
- Navigate and place objects with spatial context
- Generate "mental maps" of level layouts

## 📊 **Output Examples**
```
🧭 Spatial Analysis from World Origin (0,0,0):

📍 NORTHEAST Quadrant (X+, Y+):
  • StaticMeshActor_18 at (2500, 2800, 0) - 3785 units away
  • StaticMeshActor_24 at (400, 2800, 0) - 2829 units away

📍 NORTHWEST Quadrant (X-, Y+):
  • TextRenderActor_1 at (-0.1, 1100, 140) - 1109 units away

📍 VERTICAL Distribution:
  • Sky elements: 820-1020 units above origin
  • Ground level: 0-100 units from origin
  • Underground: -6850 units below origin

📍 Density Analysis:
  • Highest concentration: Eastern regions (2000-3000 X range)
  • Sparse areas: Western regions (negative X)
  • Vertical spread: 7870 units total range
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Approach**
1. Get all actors and their positions
2. Calculate distance and direction from origin
3. Categorize by spatial quadrants/regions
4. Analyze density and distribution patterns
5. Generate comprehensive spatial report

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**
- **Real-time spatial tracking** as actors move
- **3D visualization** of spatial data
- **Pathfinding integration** using spatial knowledge
- **Collision detection** using spatial mapping
- **Level optimization** suggestions based on spatial analysis

## 💡 **Use Cases**
- Level design analysis and optimization
- Actor placement recommendations
- Spatial relationship understanding
- Navigation and pathfinding
- Performance optimization through spatial awareness
